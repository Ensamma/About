# **STEP 2**

This is the second step in the process towards automation!

# (1) Select how far into automation you want to get

**No matter the level of automation you need, start here!**

Select your level of automation 

| [Microcontroller](HardwareBeginner.md#2-microcontroller-hardware) | [Computer Controlled](HardwareBeginner.md#2-microcontroller-hardware) |
| --- | --- |
| Basic Den hosting | All microcontroller programs plus... | 
| Day Skipping | Automated Dynamax Adventures! |
| Egg Hatchers | Den Hosting with stats!  |
| Unattended Shiny Hunts | Autonomous Shiny Hunts! |

*The levels of automation build off each other, to do Auto Max Lair you have to proceed trhough Microcontroller and Computer Controlled tutorials. You have been warned.*

# (2) Microcontroller Hardware

_Buy the necessary items from A & B._

### A. Buy hardware under the column of what type of Switch you have.

| Switch | Switch Lite |
| --- | --- |
| Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adapter. ([example 0](https://www.amazon.com/Cmple-Pack-Male-5-Pin-Adapter/dp/B00A1PH0ZW), [example 1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00P0GI68M)) | Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adapter. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QJTX59H/)) |
|     | A USB hub or portable dock. ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JK9DFKH)) |

### B. Buy the following Microcontroller

[Arduino Leonardo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0786LJQ8K) 

### C. Verify you have the following

1. A Mini-USB male to USB-A male cable or adaptor (from step (2)A)
2. An Arduino **Leonardo** (from step (2)2B)
3. A USB hub or portable dock (if you have a Switch Lite!)

Switch Lite notes:
   > The Switch Lite does not have a USB-A port. Therefore you need either an adapter or a hub to connect the Teensy. A charging hub or dock is required to simultaneously charge and use the Teensy.
   > 
   > Portable docks will work for the Switch Lite, but it will not be able to output video over the HDMI.

If you are doing Computer Controlled or Auto Max Lair automation, proceed below to buy more hardware.

# (3) Additional Computer Controlled Hardware

_Buy the necessary items from A, B, C, & D._

### A. Serial UART board

Purchase the following serial board

[Adafruit UART](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954)

### B. Serial Board Connections

Purchase the following Board Connection

[Mini-Grabbers to Male Jumer Wires](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M5GNY47)

### C. Capture Card

Purchase a Video capture card ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088HBRM7T))

### D. HDMI Cables

Purchase HDMI cable(s) if you don't own any

***Important:** You will need a fairly powerful computer to handle serial programs with video feedback. For a single Switch with video feedback, we recommend a quad core computer no older than 2015. If you want to run 4 Switches all with feedback, we recommend a modern 8-core computer. The computer must also be running 64-bit Windows, though plan to extend support to other operating systems in the future.*

> There are many ways to set this up with varying cost and difficulty. Here we will present some simple options that do not require soldering. If you are experienced with electronics, feel free to do your own thing.
