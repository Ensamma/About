# **STEP 2**

This is the second step in the process towards automation!

# (1) Select how far into automation you want to get

**No matter the level of automation you need, start here!**

Select your level of automation 

| [Microcontroller](HardwareBeginner.md#2-microcontroller-hardware) | [Computer Controlled](HardwareBeginner.md#2-microcontroller-hardware) |
| --- | --- |
| Basic Den hosting | All microcontroller programs plus... | 
| Day Skipping | Automated Dynamax Adventures! |
| Egg Hatchers | Den Hosting with stats!  |
| Unattended Shiny Hunts | Autonomous Shiny Hunts! |

*The levels of automation build off each other, to do Auto Max Lair you have to proceed trhough Microcontroller and Computer Controlled tutorials. You have been warned.*

# (2) Microcontroller Hardware

_Buy the following items below._

**A.** [Arduino Leonardo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0786LJQ8K) 

**B.** If you have a Switch Lite; buy a USB hub or portable dock 

([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JK9DFKH))
> The above link is an example. Any USB hub (with a USB port) or portable dock should work.

**Verify you have the following**

1. An Arduino **Leonardo** (from step (2)A)
2. A USB hub or portable dock (if you have a Switch Lite!)

## **If you are only doing Microcontroller Automation proceed to the next step [here](https://github.com/Ensamma/Microcontroller/blob/master/Wiki/Hardware/README.md)**
If you are doing Computer Controlled or Auto Max Lair automation, proceed below to buy more hardware.

# (3) Additional Computer Controlled Hardware

_Buy the necessary items from A, B, C, & D._

**A.** [Adafruit UART](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954)

**B.** [Mini-Grabbers to Male Jumer Wires](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M5GNY47)

**C.** Purchase a Video capture card ([example](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088HBRM7T))

> Most cheap capture cards work. Higher end-capture cards may cause issues with color detection.

**D.** HDMI Cables (if you don't own any)

***Important:** You will need a fairly powerful computer to handle serial programs with video feedback. For a single Switch with video feedback, we recommend a quad core computer no older than 2015. If you want to run 4 Switches all with feedback, we recommend a modern 8-core computer. The computer must also be running 64-bit Windows, though plan to extend support to other operating systems in the future.*

> There are many ways to set this up with varying cost and difficulty. Here we will present some simple options that do not require soldering. If you are experienced with electronics, feel free to do your own thing.
